                        <p class="card-text">A partnership firm is run in accordance with the partnership deed that each member mutually executes. With their common agreement, the partners can select how to run the company. Additionally, even after partnership deed registration is finished, the partnership deed may still be modified in accordance with the requirements. As long as the firm is protected by the signed agreement, the partners are free to operate the business as they see fit.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The registration of a limited liability partnership establishes a distinct legal existence from its participants. The LLP Act of 2008, permits the company to enter into agreements with other organisations, file lawsuits, own property, and borrow money under the LLP's name. It gives the company the freedom to run autonomously and forever, regardless of partner changes or deaths.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Having a distinct legal personality is the main benefit of registering as a Limited Liability Partnership rather than a Partnership Firm. As a result, LLP offers its partners a restricted liability benefit. According to the LLP agreement, the partners' liability is limited to the capital contribution in the event of a business loss or insolvency. Furthermore, no partner is liable for the carelessness or wrongdoing of the other partners.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">An LLP's functioning framework, including the partners' rights and responsibilities, are clarified by the LLP Agreement, a deed between the partners. LLPs usually have a "Designated Member" in charge of day-to-day management. Both individuals and already-existing businesses may be members. Additionally, this structure makes it possible to specify the partners' duties and obligations precisely. It might also aid in safeguarding the partner's interests in the event that they are lost due to an illegal act committed by another partner.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">An LLP is subject to less compliance standards than a private limited company. Until a specific amount of turnover or contribution is reached, there is no mandatory audit need. LLPs are not subject to the same regulations as corporations regarding board meetings, statutory meetings, etc. It is a cost-effective formation type to maintain because professional services for compliance are usually offered at lower costs than those for businesses.</p>

                        Both registered and unregistered partnerships are recognised by law, according to the Partnership Act. Although it is not required, partnership registration is advantageous because of the consequences of non-registration. Unregistered partnerships are typically preferred by startups until they stabilise. After it is formed, the unregistered partnership may be registered at any moment.

                        The firm is unable to sue any partners or third parties because it is not registered. Additionally, the partnership business cannot be sued by a partner for his claim. To enforce their claims or obligations, third parties may, nevertheless, file a lawsuit against the company. Third-party rights are unaffected by non-registration. To eliminate the aforementioned effects, the partnership may also be registered at any point after it is formed.
