        <h2>Why Choose Allied Business Consultancy for Small Business Registration?</h2>
        <p>Small businesses are perhaps the most common way to run businesses in India. A sole proprietor is a person who conducts business, and a proprietorship firm is the name of the business entity that they operate under. An individual's identity and a business's identity are the same. People choose this structure during the early stages of business because of its lower tax rate, flexibility, and many benefits. However, lack of knowledge often causes issues for small business owners. At Allied Business Consultancy, we help sole proprietors and freelancers get the right start in the business landscape.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Registering a Private Limited Company</h2>

        <h3>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>Establishing and registering a sole proprietorship is comparatively simple. Setting up this firm doesn't require any particular steps. When compared to other business structures, the cost of registering as a single proprietorship is also extremely low. The owner's identity is the foundation of the company. Any legitimate business can be operated by someone under his own name or under a separate legal name as a brand.</p>

        <h3>Autonomy and Control</h3>
        <p>The owner of a sole proprietorship has complete control over what they do and how they run their business. It is not necessary for a proprietor to report someone or accept orders from others. There isn't any outside intervention. There aren't many transparency or compliance requirements for the entire fiscal year, in contrast to a corporate firm. Therefore, there is also relatively little government intervention.</p>

        <h3>Profitability</h3>
        <p>Since the proprietor is the sole owner of the company, he is entitled to the entire profit. Additionally, the proprietor's assets are treated as the business's assets, and vice versa. He is free to choose when to reserve or take a profit.</p>

        <h3>Tax Advantages</h3>
        <p>For income tax purposes, a proprietorship is not regarded differently. The tax slab designated for an individual's income solely applies to company income. The tax rates are lower than those of other business structures, such as partnerships and companies. Deductions are an extra benefit of combined ITR for both individuals and businesses.</p>

        <h2>Deciding the Name of Your Small Business</h2>

        <h3>Brief and Easy</h3>
        <p>The name should be easy to spell and remember, and it shouldn't be too long or complicated.</p>

        <h3>Business Objective</h3>
        <p>For customers to readily connect a firm with its products, a portion of the name should allude to the business activity.</p>

                        A sole proprietorship firm's name cannot be registered through any registry or legislation. As a result, a sole proprietorship can choose any name as long as it doesn't violate any registered trademarks and is available. The only method to guarantee the exclusive use of a business name is to register it as a trademark, as there is no registration or law for registering a proprietorship's name.

                        The Reserve Bank of India requires the proprietor to present two forms of proprietorship registration in addition to their PAN card, proof of identity, and proof of address in order to open a bank account in the name of a sole proprietorship firm. The two types of registration can be any of the following: professional licence, chartered accountant certificate, GST registration, MSME registration, Shop & Establishment Act registration, or other types specified in the RBI's Know Your Customer guidelines or the requirements of the individual banks.
