    <!-- What is HUF -->
    <section id="what-is-huf" class="my-5">
        <h2>What is a HUF Account?</h2>
        <p>An HUF Account is a distinct and recognized form of business entity under Indian tax laws. It is formed through Hindu law, typically upon the marriage of an individual. The HUF consists of members who share a common ancestry, residence, and family property.</p>
        <h3>Karta</h3>
        <p>The Karta, often the patriarch of the family, holds the authority to make decisions on behalf of family members. This pivotal role involves managing family affairs and representing the HUF in various capacities.</p>
        <h3>Co-Parceners</h3>
        <p>Co-parceners possess the right to claim a share of the family property when opting to separate from the HUF account. The hierarchy of co-parceners extends through four degrees within the family structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1st Degree: The individual holding ancestral property for the first time.</li>
            <li>2nd Degree: Sons and daughters.</li>
            <li>3rd Degree: Grandsons.</li>
            <li>4th Degree: Great-grandsons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding these roles is crucial for efficient HUF account registration, a process that unlocks valuable tax benefits for the family unit.</p>

        <h2>Requirements For HUF Account Registration For Tax Benefits</h2>
        <p>To establish a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) and avail associated tax benefits, certain criteria must be met:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Family Requirement:</strong> HUF account formation requires a family; an individual cannot initiate it. The family includes the descendants of a common ancestor, unmarried daughters, and their wives.</li>
            <li><strong>Marriage Implication:</strong> Marriage automatically leads to the creation of a HUF.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligible Communities:</strong> HUF accounts can be formed by individuals belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Formal Registration:</strong> Following its creation, HUF must undergo formal registration. This involves a legal deed specifying details of HUF account members and its business activities. Additionally, acquiring a PAN number and opening a dedicated bank account are essential components of the registration process.</li>
            <li><strong>Common Corpus:</strong> After formation, each member has the liberty to deposit their income into the common HUF corpus.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> HUF account members can leverage various tax benefits under applicable sections.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Unlock Tax Advantages With HUF's Financial Benefits</h2>
        <p>Forming a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) not only provides a distinct PAN number but also unlocks several tax advantages, enhancing overall financial planning.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Income Tax Privileges</h4>
                <p>As a separate legal entity with its own PAN, the HUF can generate income, conduct business, and invest in various assets, all while enjoying the basic exemption limit of 2.5 lakhs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Residential Property Ownership</h4>
                <p>The Indian Income Tax Act stipulates that if an individual possesses multiple residential properties, only one is considered self-occupied, and taxes are levied on the rest. By establishing a HUF, you can own multiple residential properties without incurring additional taxes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Life Insurance Deductions</h4>
                <p>Similar to individual taxpayers benefiting from a deduction of Rs.1,50,000 on specified investments and life insurance premiums under section 80C, HUFs can also claim this benefit, reducing their taxable income.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Investment Opportunities</h4>
                <p>HUFs can explore tax-saving investment avenues such as Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) and avail tax benefits of up to Rs.1,50,000 under section 80C.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
                <h4>Health Insurance Advantage</h4>
                <p>While individuals receive a deduction of Rs.25,000 annually on health insurance premiums for their family under section 80D, this might fall short as premiums rise. A HUF, however, can claim an additional deduction of Rs.25,000, resulting in a total health insurance premium deduction of Rs.50,000.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>By leveraging these tax benefits, a HUF becomes a strategic financial entity, optimizing tax liabilities and promoting long-term financial well-being.</p>
