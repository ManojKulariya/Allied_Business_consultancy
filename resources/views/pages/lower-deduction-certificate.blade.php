        <h2>Understanding the Significance of Form 13 Under Section 197</h2>
        <p>Form 13 is the cornerstone of the application for a lower deduction of TDS. You need to file Form 13 with the Assessing Officer (TDS) to obtain the LDC. Once the AO goes through the details in Form 13 and is satisfied with it, they issue the Lower Tax Deduction Certificate. Without this certificate, you cannot lower the TDS amount, even if it is legitimate.</p>
        <p>From documentation to the application process, everything about Form 13 can be challenging. Partnering with experts is the only way to cruise through the process.</p>
        <p>Need expert assistance to file Form 13? We are here to help.</p>
