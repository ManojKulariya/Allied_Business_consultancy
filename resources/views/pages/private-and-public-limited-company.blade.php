                        The most money that a business can raise, either now or in the future, through the issuance of shares is known as authorised capital. If the business wants to raise money by issuing new equity, authorised capital can also be raised later. The authorised capital is used to pay the stamp duty required for company registration. On the other hand, paid-up capital is the sum that shareholders actually pay to issue shares. In India, a company may be incorporated with any paid-up capital, which may be less than or equal to the authorised capital.
