                <h3>Registration</h3>

                <h3>Tax Computation</h3>

                        A person who makes money via the practice of a trade, profession, job, or calling is subject to a direct tax known as professional tax. The government of a state or union territory in India imposes a professional tax, as opposed to the Central Government which levies income tax. When it comes to salaried and wage earners, the employer is required to take professional tax from their pay and deposit the money to the state government. For other categories of people, the employee is responsible for paying this tax. There is a maximum tax amount of Rs. 2500/- per year; however, the tax calculation and amount collected may differ between States.

                        In India, employers are required to deduct professional tax from employees' paychecks and submit the information to the government. Employers are "deductors" who are responsible for gathering professional tax from their employees and submitting it to the government.

                        Professional tax payments cannot exceed INR 2,500 annually. Typically, a professional's gross income determines the professional tax slab amount. Every month, it takes it out of his pay. The nodal body responsible for collecting professional tax on the basis of predefined tax slabs, which differ for each state and union territory, is the Commercial Taxes Department. Although it can be paid either annually or monthly, the tax is computed based on the individual's yearly taxable income.
